		<h2>About Farrago Parking</h2>
		<p>Our project makes use of the ACT governments parking data to releate seamingly unrelated events. It will bring a bit of Farrago chaos to the order of parking.</p>
		<p>In the future we would like to see it expanded to include theme based events (i.e. when you find an empty parking spot you recieve a good news story. when you overstay in your spot you revieve a bad nes story.</p>
		<p>While our projects focuses on a limited time frain because the data avaliable is limited at this time we envission in the future that it could have wider application in several areas including event hotspots. i.e. say a application user is looking for a park this application extension could inform them why there is no car parks avaliable and provide them with a alternative means off getting to their desired location.</p>
		<p>Additionally to our initial idea it could also have a comercial application with stores closer to parking spaces being able to by application advertising time for thos spaces in return if a shoper makes a pursach in their store who has used the application they can get their parking validated for free or similar.</p>
		
		<h2>About MakeHackVoid</h2>
		<p>MakeHackVoid is modeled on an <a href="https://hackerspaces.org">international community of like minded spaces</a> that started in Germany in 1995. It supports and encourages arts, science and technology culture in the ACT by providing a <a href="https://makehackvoid.com/our-space/">physical space</a> for Canberra residents, as well as national and international visitors to meet, interact and create.</p>
		<p>We hold public meetups every Tuesday from 6:30pm. These <a href="https://makehackvoid.com/meetings/">meetups</a> are where we invite you to join us and chat, participate in show and tell, get help or advice, or talk about your projects. We are open at other times throughout the week for drop ins, workshops, general hacking and socialising; check the calendar for planned sessions and watch our twitter feed and announce mailing list for notifications of the space opening.</p>
		<p>Our group includes people with diverse backgrounds and interests. MakeHackVoid is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone.</p>
